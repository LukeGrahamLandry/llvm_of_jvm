// Alas, java classes cannot be generic over primitive types. HACK: 
// A new version of this file will be generated for each of [byte, short, char, int, float, double].
// The string TYPE will be replaced by one of the primitive types. 
// This allows testing operations that should work on all primitives without writing the same code repeatedly.
