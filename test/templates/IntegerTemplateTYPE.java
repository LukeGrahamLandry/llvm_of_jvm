// Alas, java classes cannot be generic over primitive types. HACK: 
// A new version of this file will be generated for each of [byte, short, int, long].
// The string TYPE will be replaced by one of the integer primitive types. 
// The string SIZE will be replaced by [1, 2, 4, 8] respectively. 
// This allows testing operations that should work on all integers without writing the same code repeatedly.
